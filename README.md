# alfred-extension
To-Do Chrome extension to help focus what needs done
Dev Notes to Lando:
    // can use browser_action to change and add badge to toolbar etc.
    // https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction
    * I'd like Alfred to be a sidebar to interact with. The popup can do quick actions maybe, and open and close alfred. Maybe use browser_action to set up the badge to just open and close him
